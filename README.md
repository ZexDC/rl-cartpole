# Reinforcement Learning - Cart-Pole problem

This project includes a Proximity Policy Optimization algorithm implementation to control the cart pole in OpenAI Gym.
PPO makes also use of the Actor-Critic algorithm implementation behind the scenes.

The repository contains the code for the implementation, models and output results.
There are three different mains to launch, for train/test of discrete action space, continuous action space and stable baselines respectively.
Pytorch, StableBaselines3 and OpenAI Gym packages are a requirement to run the code.
